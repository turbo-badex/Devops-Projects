Step 3: Select the runner image and architecture of your EC2 instance. In my case, here I selected Linux and x64

Step 5: Add some secrets contained in our workflow like DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_KEY which are the username and password needed to login to dockerhub to push our image after building.

Go to your repositoryâ€™s settings. Select secrets and variables under Actions and click on New repository secret to add the key and value.
